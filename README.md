**Project Title:** Conversational Q&A Chatbot using Gemini Pro (SmartBot)

**Summary:**

This project showcases the development of a conversational question-and-answer chatbot using Google's Gemini Pro large language model. Built with Python and the Streamlit framework, the chatbot provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for engaging in text-based conversations. Key features include:

*   **Real-time Interaction:** Users can input prompts or questions and receive immediate responses generated by the Gemini Pro model.
*   **Chat History:** The application maintains a chronological history of the conversation, displaying both user inputs and Gemini's responses in a visually appealing manner, with timestamps.
*   **Asynchronous Operation:** Utilizes asynchronous programming (`asyncio`) to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience while Gemini generates the text.
*   **Streamlit Interface:** Deployed using the Streamlit library, providing a simple way to create an interactive web-based application.
*   **API Integration:** Leverages the Google Generative AI API (Gemini Pro) to power the chatbot's responses.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to catch exceptions during API calls and present user friendly error messages.
*   **Responsive Design:** The chat bubbles have a modern design and are displayed to the left and right, making it easy to follow the chat flow.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **Python:** Primary programming language.
*   **Google Generative AI API (Gemini Pro):** The language model powering the chatbot.
*   **Streamlit:** Framework for building the interactive web application.
*   **asyncio:** Python library for asynchronous programming.
*  **.env:** Used to store the GOOGLE_API_KEY securely.
